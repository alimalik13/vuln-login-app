# 🔐 Vulnerable Login App – XSS & SQL Injection Practice

This is a deliberately vulnerable Flask web app built for hands-on testing and learning about:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

It simulates a login system with real attack scenarios, making it a great resource for ethical hackers, cybersecurity students, and CTF learners.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Python Flask-based web app
- Login form with no input validation
- SQLite backend with 20 dummy users
- Basic HTML/CSS styling for realism
- Reflected XSS and raw SQL query injection points

---

## 🚨 Vulnerabilities Demonstrated

### 🔸 SQL Injection

Login query vulnerable to SQLi:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<input>' AND password = '<input>'

Try inputs like:

' OR '1'='1

### 🔸 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Reflected XSS example input:

<script>alert('XSS!')</script>
